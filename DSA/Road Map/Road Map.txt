This the Road Map for DSA where U will get the Proper FLOW of DSA Which Will Help U for Efective lerning of DSA,
As I will Code In C++ So Whatever Collection, or Containers i will Use U can Use The Alternative For your language 
which u are using.

We will Cover One by One Combining Data Structures and algorithm ,I will Add Further Things If Required 
To Make it more simplify
